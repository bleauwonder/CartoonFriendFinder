## Welcome to finding your best match with Cartoon Friend Finder!

### By answering a few simple questions about yourself, you'll be matched with the cartoon character that you'd best get along with. It's not what cartoon character are you? But who is your best cartoon pal! 

### Enter your name and a great photo and have fun answering the survey statements to see who pops up.

### This was an interesting way to use Express to handle routing. It's a full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys and compare the results with the cartoon friends API that I created with JSON. 

### The technologies used in this app:
#### * node.js
#### * express
#### * Ajax
#### * Bootstrap


##### I was the sole contributor to this app.
